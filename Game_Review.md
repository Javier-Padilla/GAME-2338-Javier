I give Fallout: New Vegas a review rating of 5 out of 7 when viewing it from the lens 

## Summary

  In fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic game where you take on the role of The Courier, a mailman who has hit a "24-karot run of bad luck" as described by one of the characters within the game. A package you were
tasked with delivering happens to hold something very crucial to ending the power struggle within the Mojave (the desert where the game takes place) and everyone is desperate to get it.
This desperation leads to you being captured and almost killed by a mysterious person only to later wake up with nothing but your pip-boy and the worn clothes on your back. 

The task becomes to find out who shot you in the head and why whatever you were carrying was so important that they would do such a thing. In your travels you will meet various factions
all batteling it out for the control of the mojave. Retellings of "The Battle of Hover Dam" has seem to leave every faction reeling, even the victorius NCR( New California Republic) seems exhausted. Every faction has spent so long setting up their traps and power plays that each one is too scared to pull the trigger in response to what the other has. They all lack the resources to lose another great battle, but one man can change that.

As you travel through the mojave for what starts out as clear reasons, you find yourself stuck in the middle of every faction reaching out to you for help and it is up to you to decide who gains the upper hand.
Rumors are that another great battle for the Hover Dam is on the cusp and your efforts can very well be the thing that changes the outcome of the battle. No matter which choices you make and what you discover, one thing is clear.
The Mojave will never be the same.
  

## Final Thoughts

One thing is clear about Fallout: New Vegas, it is a classic. When the game had first released back in 2010,it was outstanding and the fact that the game still has a loving community speaks volumes.
Nostalgia is a powerful thing however, so how does it stand up to modern day standards? The answer to that is surprisngly well. While it may not be as modern as something like Red Dead Redemption 2, there is a ton of quality here that allows you to overlook most of the problems. 

Let us start with the pros that make me adore this game as a first timer in the year 2021. The writing is absolutely brilliant and in an RPG game, you suprisingly do not get that a lot. Characters pop in personality even if their face models ressemble that of melted pizza.
Good characterization is done when you start making assumptions about characters. Veronica( a character in Fallout: New Vegas) would probably love to live a normal life and enjoy doing make up and dancing. I can infer this based on how she talks to the military force around her, how she begs to find a cute dress in a wasteland, how she litertally wants to go have fun and dance.
she is just a person who wanted to enjoy a normal life but was instead born into a society that was focused on the mission and the mission only. Every companion and major character gets this treatment.

Another important aspect is the fact that choices matter, not something that every RPG does right. While exploring and killing your way in the Mojave, you will have assassination teams of rival factions come after you, 
text will appear telling you that which factions you will piss off doing certain tasks, characters will treat you differently or may even attack you on sight. I think it is so important in an RPG that you cannot be friends with most people.
People in real life have strong opinions that they are often willing to fight for and that is represented well in Fallout: New Vegas. Along with the differentness in treatment from most npcs, the endings avilable to the game are vastly different and they all depend on your actions.

Great characters and an evolving world are the foundation to the great design of quests that help build the tone of the world that you are traveling. A fortress of super-mutants sit atop a hill, long gone ruins lay in waste, broken cities draw you in with suffocating atmosphere of stores and community. All of these land marks give Fallout: New Vegas what I call
"The breath of the wild" factor. A silloute of something off in the distance draws you to explore for another hour, then another thing and another. This loop of a fortress on a hill repeats keeping the player exploring the wasteland continuously on end. As for the quest design, I have a rule. 
For a quest to be a good one it must either change how you view the world or change how you view a certain character. A quest can be as simple as traveling from one point to another so long as I get to learn more about the world or hear a perspective of a character.
A quest like "grab some flowers for me. ok thanks" is a bad quest. A quest like "My wife died and the flower I would pick for her are upton a hill of mutants, can you retrieve them for me?" only for you to come back and attend the grave together is a good quest. 
Though there is no big end, it is simple, subtle, and teaches you about how even in a post-apocalyptic where death is rampant, death is not normalized. It hits just as hard. Every quest in Fallout: New Vegas carrys this montra of importance with quests.
Doing something like repairing a plane sounds mundane, but when the group you are repairing it with talks down to you as a savage and does not fully trust you, it gets interesting. 
Context like that makes every side quest big or small feel interesting to take part in.

While the story, writing, quests and character are fantastic, there is still a bit of bad that cannot be overlooked and that is in the gameplay side. As known by everyone who plays it, the gunplay is boring beyond reason. Shooting and being shot at has no weight at all making a race between you and the enemies of who can stand still and fire faster.
I found myself enjoying melee weapons a lot more, not because they felt better but because they did significantly more damage and allowed combat to be over way quicker. You know combat is bad
when the player wants combat to be over for the wrong reasons. It could be chalked up to being a sign of the times, but games like the original Red Dead Redemption came out that year. Obsidian is not a FPS studio, but it is clear that the tech for combat could have used more testing.

Along with that complaint, the run speed of the character is so ungodly slow that it can turn retracking for items or quests into such a slog. For anyone not playing on pc and unable to install a mod to increase movement speed, I am so sorry.
The quest log could have also been done better. Thins like inventory are clearly divided among each other and finding things like consumables is a breeze, but quests seem to go into the same log all together and start to blend. No speration for main quests, companion quests or anything else.

Though these complaints are small, combat and exploration is two of the three big things that make up this game. They are not bad enough to ruin the expience all together, they simply just hinder the brilliance of the game with their mediocrity.
For its 2010 state, I believe this is a fair review but should it get a remaster, I could see these problems being remedied.
