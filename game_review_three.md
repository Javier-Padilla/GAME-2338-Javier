### Rating

On my rating scale of 1-7, I would give Minecraft a 6/7.
## Summary
In the game "Minecraft", you awake in a procedurally generated world and are thrown into the world to fend for yourself. You will gather resources and food to try and build a base for
yourself before the night comes as enemies come out in droves looking to hunt you at night. In order to get better tools for yourself and increase your survivability and base, you must mine
and craft. A vast variety of things for you to craft and collect await you in the overworld and once you have built a world for yourself that you can be proud of, you begin your hunt for the Enderdragon.
Being resourceful and brave will allow you to slay the Enderdragon and make your mark on the world.

Almost anything can be mined and collected which allows for you to build whatever your mind wishes to build- even computers. The only limit is the limit of your imagination as you go about ur journey of survival and creativity.
If you wish to enjoy the world instead of fighting for survival and against hunger, then you can join the creative mode where you have access to everything that can be found in the game. 
In creative mode, you can fly around and build whatever you want with whatever you want as you do not need to go collect these items in the world. 

In addition, there are plenty of mini-games and servers inacting mini-games that you can participate in adding even more variety to the game. Skins can be created for your player with various programs and expansions can be added to the game with dlc mods.
Some mods add whole new areas and items to collect and some simply add skins to everything in the game like the Christmas time skin that changes everything into a festive wonderland. No matter what you wish to do, there is probably some enjoyment to get out of Minecraft.



## Final Thoughts

This game is a pure classic in my opinion. The game attempts to deliever the feeling of infinite possibilities and wonder and delivers that one hundered percent. Firstly, the game
hits the mark directly on the correctness quality factor. When playing a procedurally generated game, you expect change and different experiences to be plentiful and Minecraft does that to a crazy extent. 
Everything from special enemies spawning, biomes, items, mobs, nether, the end, and landmarks are all randomly generated allowing each world you start to feel unique and full of wonder.
You may have been playing Minecraft for hours upon hours and suddenly you see a horse get struck by lightning turning it into a skeleton horse or maybe you see a baby zombie riding a spider. 
Those are just a few couple examples of how these random factors can provide true change that make coming back to the game so easy. So many procedurally generated games start to lose their charm as the player
encounters almost all of the possibilites but Minecraft almost never runs into that problem. You may spawn on island full of turtles and must somehow sail to the nearest mainland, maybe you spawn in a frozen tundra or maybe in a dense jungle.
There is so much to see in Minecraft and is exactly what I expect a procedurally generated game to be.

When hearing about all these changing factors and the expansive world, you would expect that this game would require a powerful engine to run but that is not the case. This games efficency is insane in comparable to what it gives.
First off, the game uses low-resolution pixel art to animate and show everything in the world which means that this wonderful package of a game can run on some of the oldest pieces of tech. In turn,
Minecraft is also really reliable due to how efficient it runs. In my many hours of playing Minecraft, I have almost never encountered a bug or crash due to how low matience the game is.

The only reason that Minecraft does not get a perfect score is due to the combat being very one-dimensional and that there is almost no real story but that is okay. Minecraft is not about combat or story because it does not need it.
You and your experiences are the story that Minecraft tells and it tells a new one every time.
