## Summary

In the game Magic the Gathering, you take on the role as a planeswalker! a powerful sorcerer who harnesses the elements of the planes to battle their enemies and expand their knowledge. These elements are often referred to as these five colors; red, blue, green, white, and black. Each color has its own identity and place within the planes to help keep balance within everything and it is your job to figure out which colors you want to draw on for your magic. 

Red is the color of passion, ferocity, emotion and strength. Red cards are about hitting fast and hard, A lot of red cards deal direct damage to enemies and summon creatures that run the second they get summoned. Blue is the color of ingenuity, wit, and cleverness. Blue cards are all about planning ahead and being strategic which involves drawing cards, countering spells, and even time travel. Green is the color of beauty, nature, and the wild. Green focus's on stomping out opponents with the terrifying beautiful forces of nature, this consists of gigantic creatures, huge spells, and life regeneration. White is the color of purity, bravery, and selflessness. White plays huge defences to halt their opponent in place and stop their evil deeds while creating armies to beat your opponent; they have lifegain, a ton of creatures, and ways to remove creatures. The last color is black, the color of conniving, power, and viciousness. Black aims to win by any means which could be sacraficing your own creatures or even your own life. They have a lot of cards all about siphoning life, summoning huge demons at a great cost, and murdering everything in your path.

Now that you have heard what the colors do, it is time to pick which ones suit you the best and make a powerful deck. To make a deck, you take 60 cards made up of spells and lands. These spells come from the colors I just described, you have red cards, blue cards, green cards, white cards, and black cards, but what is stopping you from using all the colors? lands. You need lands of the corresponding color in order to cast the spells you need, you need a certain amount of blue lands to cast a blue spell and so on. So now that you have your colors picked, your spells and lands together, it is time to duel other planeswalkers!

## Final Thoughts

Magic the Gathering is the definitive card game to play, if you like strategic card games at all then you owe it to yourself to play the grandaddy of it all. Since its release in 1993, Magic has been at the forefront of table top gaming right along Dungeons and Dragons, but how does its online adaptation fair? I would say fairly well.

Being that Arena is pretty much a port of the table top game to an online platform, it works really well at conveying and delivering the atmosphere of the game. I believe that Magic the Gathering:Arena hits the mark on the correctness factor of the game. It is almost as if you were playing the game in at your own home table with all of your buddies. There is a great tutorial at teaching new players, all the phases and interactions work well if not better, new sets release the same time as physical sets release helping to unify the community. There has never been an easier way to learn how to play magic and then crack open packs and play. It is faithful to the game entirely and is a good jumping off point for those that want to try the game for free.

This also in turn makes the usability really good. I have tried to explain Magic the Gathering to friends in person and they almost always have questions but Magic the Gathering: Arena effortlessly teaches the ropes to completely new players. It also helps that the in game economy uses gold and gems, an almost universal economy style for a lot of games making it easy to distinguish values between the two if it was not already clear. 

There is one issue that arrises however, but this issue is standard with any online competitive game and that is the creation of a "meta". When a new Magic set comes out, there is wild experimenting to see what decks are the best and then after that period, the game becomes the same 5 decks over and over that you face against. This meta is counteracted in the table top game because cards can cost a lot of money and not all players will want to spend that much as well as there being smaller community metas of the area around you. In Magic the Gathering: Arena, players can get wild cards which allow them to craft any card they want which means getting what would be rare or expensive cards somewhat achievable. It is not easy to get a lot of wildcards, but it is easy enough to get enough cards for a top tier deck which is good and bad. It just leads to staleness withthe game which gets the point taken from an almost perfect game.
