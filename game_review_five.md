## Summary

In the game Magic the Gathering, you take on the role as a planeswalker! a powerful sorcerer who harnesses the elements of the planes to battle their enemies and expand their knowledge. These elements are often referred to as these five colors; red, blue, green, white, and black. Each color has its own identity and place within the planes to help keep balance within everything and it is your job to figure out which colors you want to draw on for your magic. 

Red is the color of passion, ferocity, emotion and strength. Red cards are about hitting fast and hard, A lot of red cards deal direct damage to enemies and summon creatures that run the second they get summoned. Blue is the color of ingenuity, wit, and cleverness. Blue cards are all about planning ahead and being strategic which involves drawing cards, countering spells, and even time travel. Green is the color of beauty, nature, and the wild. Green focus's on stomping out opponents with the terrifying beautiful forces of nature, this consists of gigantic creatures, huge spells, and life regeneration. White is the color of purity, bravery, and selflessness. White plays huge defences to halt their opponent in place and stop their evil deeds while creating armies to beat your opponent; they have lifegain, a ton of creatures, and ways to remove creatures. The last color is black, the color of conniving, power, and viciousness. Black aims to win by any means which could be sacraficing your own creatures or even your own life.
