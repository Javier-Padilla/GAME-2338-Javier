## Summary

Overwatch is a competitive hero shooter that has a variety of heroes all with unique abilities that manage to play off each other which allows for diverse and interesting team composition. The game consists of three main game modes, those being capture the point, escort the payload, and a hybrid between the two. These three game modes will take place on a variety of interactable maps that have insane detail and color that help add personality and build on the flavor of the world. 

An unrest in the world has caused great catastrophe and a once legendary hero organization is needed once more to step in and save the world, that is the basis behind Overwatch.
Each team is consisted of these legendary heroes fighting against each other to capture or defend these points. Each heroe has their own in depth back story for why they fight which adds to their character to make each one feel unique and special in their own way. Genji is a cybernetic ninja betrayed by his brother, Soldier-76 is a hero long thought dead that roams the streets as a vigilante, and Winston is just a super intellegent monkey. There are plenty more character beyond those three to learn and play as, all with their own kits that suit them.

Though the game has no "story mode" the characters have a huge ammount of voice lines that will come up in matches. Certain characters will interact with each other based on the 
team composition which provides small glimpses into the lore of the world that is ever expanding. Choose the character that speaks to you, load into a match with your team and begin the fight as you learn the small quirks of your character in order to save the world. 

## Final Thoughts
The idea of Overwatch was a great one and Overwatch was met with great success when it first launched in 2016, however when looking at it in the year of 2021- it has fallen from grace. Firstly, I would like to talk about the things that Overwatch does right(which is a lot). Often times the usability hero based games such as League or Team Fortress 2 can be tollerable at best and horrid at worst. I remember the first time I tried getting into League and was just lost on what to do at all times, Overwatch does not have that issue. Overwatch is literally branded as the easiest first person shooter and that is not inherently a bad thing. It means that a lot of people can pick this game up and start having fun within quick play which is something not a lot fo other hero games can do. An easily accessible guide to the character you are playing that is avaliable at all times allows people to pick up and try one of the many heroes in Overwatch without the anxiety of letting your team down.

Along with usability, reliability is the most important quality factor that needs to get checked when putting out a competitive multiplayer game. If players are constantly expericening hick-ups in their matches, then you will never build a player base. Overwatch provides sturdy and reliable game play that feels solid with weight behind every attack. I cannot think of a single time where I felt like I got killed in a dumb way, the other team was just better(though I still did get mad). Not to mention the numerous systems that Overwatch is available on which attesting to the portability of the game. Reliable matches with a huge player base with a game that anyone can pick up and play, sounds like a recipe for perfection. 

That is however not the case. The main problem with Overwatch didnt come from the quality factors that help make a game, it instead came from a lack of the most important type of testing to a live service game- playtesting. Overwatch has been out for five years and the player base aswell as its thriving reviews have plummeted since its original release. The biggest reason for that is the lack of innovation throughout the year. It is possible to keep the player base engaged for a long time after release but you need inovation to do so. Destiny had "The Taken King" to breathe life into the game, World of Warcraft(despite its many problems) still has its player base, but Overwatch keeps plummeting in players over time. The game was fun in 2016 and if you logged on and played it again, you would find that it is still the same game from 2016. Sure there are new maps and characters, but nothing fundamental has changed to add to the complexity of the experience. No new modes to que into quickplay, no story based chapters that are permant, no challenges or anything. Just the exact same gameplay loop that has been there since 2016. Overwatch had an amazing headstart and simply got complacent which is why it gets a review rating of 4 out of 7. Pumping resources into playtesting new modes could have been what Overwatch needed and now that they are doing that with Overwatch 2, it may be far too late.
